To show how to use NDD, we put an example of solving the N-Queens problem with NDD under 'application/nqueen/', which has been widely used as benchmark to test the performance of different BDD libraries.

* `BDDSolution.java` - jdd
* `NDDSolution.java` - jndd
* `JavaNDDSolution.java` - javandd
* `NQueensExp.java` - run this file to compare the performance of BDD and NDD in N-Queens problem
