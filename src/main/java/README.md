- 'jdd': `jdd` library with implementation of `minAssignment` and `mk count` in node table.
- `ndd`: 2 versions of NDD, based on `jdd` and `javaBDD` respectively.
- `vector`: an implementation of BDD Vector, which is a simplified version of the implementation that only references the idea of dividing domains in NDD, and also compared with NDD in our experiments.
- `application`: some applications (such as network verifications) supported by BDD and NDD.
- `experiments`: compare the performance of BDD, BDD Vector and NDD.
